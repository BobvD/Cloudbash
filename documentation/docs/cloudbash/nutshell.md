# In a Nutshell...
### What is it?
**Overview of the system**<br>
Cloudbash is a concert management platform that will enable organizations to plan and sell tickets for concerts that are held at a physical location. The system will enable concert organizers to:
- Create concerts that are free to attend or optionally sell tickets for a set price.
- Manage guest lists and check ticket validity at the door.
Cloudbash will be a serverless application that can be easily deployed on Amazon Web Services by any organization.

### Who’s it for?
Any organization that organizes concerts (or other events) and wants to sell tickets. This can be small bars, big arenas or independent artists, holding concerts at various venues.

### Why build it?
Ticketing platforms like Eventbrite and Ticketmaster take a big cut of the sales (up to 15%). By using Cloudbash, ticket sellers can lower these costs significantly. The serverless application will scale up at busy times and scale down at slow hours- making sure you will never pay for unused servers.
